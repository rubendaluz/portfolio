                    Hello! My name is Ruben and I am a passionate Network and Computer Systems
                    Engeneer, with a love for creating innovative web applications. With a strong
                    background in computer science, I enjoy turning ideas into tangible
                    and user-friendly solutions.<br></br>
                    Collaboration and problem-solving are two values that I hold dear. I
                    thrive in a team environment, where I can work closely with
                    designers, product managers, and fellow developers to bring projects
                    to life. I believe in the power of communication and actively seek
                    feedback to continuously improve my work.<br></br>
